# CS-305
In the scenario for this project I work as a developer for Global Rain, a software engineering company. I am helping our client, Artemis Financial, with their need to moderrnize. Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans tailored to the individual. They are seeking to add file verification to their existing web application in order to ensure secure communications. I am tasked with adding secure communication mechanisms including a checksum verification. 

I succeeded in generating the necessary maven dependency reports and identifying changes to be made including the addition of checksum verification and changing to https protocol. I also included additional input validation. It is important to have secure code like this in order to ensure that breaches to customer information or manipulation of company systems does not occur. This provides value in terms of preventing the extreme loss in value that would occur in the event of an attack. 

I found understanding the limitations and false positives of the maven dependency to be the most challenging part. 

I incresed layers of security by improving https protocol, implementing checksum verification, and implementing input validation. I also improved the code structure. In the future I would use a more experienced software expert as I am not currently qualified for cyber security as it often is one of the most experienced developers who does that. 

After refactoring the code I ran the maven dependency report again in order to ensure no new vulnerabilities arose.

I primarily used the maven dependency report, our resources in each module, as well as online forumns from more experienced developers who explained how each of the concepts worked. 

In the future I would likely show employers the code and proof of the server running on https protocol as well as showing how I did that.
